Just a quick landing page challenge from my LeWagon Bootcamp.

In this challenge we learned about how to create CSS components and connect them to the stylesheet.css.

## Key Learnings:
- use `@import url()` in the stylesheet.css to connect to the components
- `@import url()` always needs to be at the top of the stylesheet or at least before any styling code!
